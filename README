#asp-mode

##About

A simple ASP mode for Emacs which does syntax highlighting and
indentation support.

I needed to use ASP at work in Emacs and it's a pain in the ass to
manually indent. There's a Visual Basic Mode knocking about which
automatically capitalises every keyboard you type but I have no use
for that, and the mode doesn't do keyword highlighting. This does.

##Installation

To automatically load files with a .asp extension, put the following                                                                                        
lines in your .emacs file:                                                                                                                                  

    (autoload 'asp-mode "asp-mode")
    (setq auto-mode-alist 
       (cons '("\\.asp\\'" . asp-mode) auto-mode-alist))
